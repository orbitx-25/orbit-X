# orbit-X

This project is built using **React + Vite**.

It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled in this template due to performance considerations.  
For enabling it, see [React Compiler documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Notes

- Built with ❤️ by the **orbit-X** team.
- Recommended setup: TypeScript with type-aware lint rules (see [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts)).
